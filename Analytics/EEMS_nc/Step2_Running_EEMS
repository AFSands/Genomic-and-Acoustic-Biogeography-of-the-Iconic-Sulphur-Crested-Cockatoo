## NOTE1: EEMS was run in an interactive node using the following parameter file and line of code (see below).
## NOTE2: This code was used to run two independant runs (i.e. run twice) with seperate seed values. 

EEMs parameter file (run_eems_galerita10k_1.ini):
datapath = pathtofile/galerita10k
mcmcpath = pathtofile/galerita10k_chain_1

nDemes = 10000
diploid = true
numMCMCIter = 20000000
numBurnIter = 10000000
numThinIter = 99999

code run: runeems_snps --params run_eems_galerita10k_1.ini --seed 123
