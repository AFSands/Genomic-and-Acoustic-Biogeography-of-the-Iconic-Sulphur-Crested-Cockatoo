## NOTE1: This script is run for each specimen independently as an array job from the directory where the outputs from Step8 can be found (i.e. "<path_to_output_directory10>".
## NOTE2: Each script is accompanied by a name list of the BQSR recalibrated .bam file names for all specimens (see Step9_namelist as an example). The job array is set as the number of .bam files that will be processed (i.e. the number of specimens).
## NOTE3: The name list file, in this case is called "namelist" and is located in the same directory as the script.
## NOTE4: Due to HaplotypeCaller being generally slow, several replicates of this script are used to call haplotypes, using separate contigs lists (see Step8_hclistA as an example), to portion the genomes into manageable segments for processing.
## NOTE5: The contig list file in this case is called "hclistA.list" and is located in the same directory as the script.
## NOTE6: A directory for temporary files needs to be created for each replicate of this script. In this specific instance a subdirectory called "tmpA" is created.
