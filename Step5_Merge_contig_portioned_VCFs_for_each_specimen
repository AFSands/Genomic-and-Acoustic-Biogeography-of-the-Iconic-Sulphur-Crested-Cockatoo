## NOTE1: This script is run for each specimen independently as an array job from the directory where the outputs from Step4 can be found (i.e. "<path_to_output_directory4>".
## NOTE2: Each script is accompanied by a name list of the VCF file names for all specimens for all replicates of Step4 (e.g. A-N) (see Step4_namelist as an example). The job array is set as the number of the number of specimens.
## NOTE3: The name list file, in this case is called "namelist" and is located in the same directory as the script.
## NOTE4: A directory for temporary files needs to be created for each replicate of this script. In this specific instance a directory called "tmp" is created as a sub directory.
